## ***Project Overview***
In this project we carry out various Information Retrieval and Machine Learning methods to retrieve articles that are most relevant to the crucial medical questions given to us as tasks.
The Major tasks assigned to us are as follows:
- What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?
- What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?
- What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?
- What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?
- What has been published about medical care?
- What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?
- Geographic variations: how the disease will spread and if there are different variations of the virus in different areas?
- What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance?
- What has been published about ethical and social science considerations?
- What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?

We have four different approaches to our project.
1. Word2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. LDA
4. TF-IDF

## ***Dataset Description***
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has over 47,000 scholarly articles related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.
It contains fields like 



## ***Our Apporaches***
Approach 1: Using spaCy for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing stopwords and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data and using Ensemble Techniques to create an aggregate prediction result.

Approach 2: Using NLTK for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing Stop words and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data.

Approach 3: Using Keras for performing Topic Modeling using LDA.

Approach 4: TF-IDF.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/josvin92/josvin92.github.io./settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
